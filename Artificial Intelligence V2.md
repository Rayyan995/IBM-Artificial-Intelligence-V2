## Introduction_to_AI

**Module One: Course Objectives**

Objectives: Introduction to AI
At the end of this unit you should be able to:

* Provide an overview of AI.
* Define AI.
* Describe the eras of computing.
* Describe the types and approaches of AI.
* Explain the relationship between the human’s way of thinking and AI systems integral components and layers.
* Describe AI integral components.
* Explain the difference between deterministic and probabilistic systems.
* Describe the factors that contributed to the growth of AI.
* Describe AI as it is applied to different industries.
* List the subfields that are the focus of AI research.
* List examples of innovations that might change our lives.

**Module Two: Introduction to AI**

The term AI was introduced by Prof. John McCarthy at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. McCarthy defines AI as the “science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.

You interact with AI systems daily but might not be aware of it. Every time that you use a search engine such as Google or Bing, explore news websites such as the BBC or the New York Times, talk to a virtual assistant such as Siri, or use an automated language translation service, you are dealing with intelligent systems. Generally, AI occupies a wide landscape and there are many potentials uses for it.

The objective of this course is to familiarize you with AI, which increases its influence over our daily lives. The course provides the information and tools that you need to start your journey into the cognitive or AI era of computing. You start the journey by defining AI.

**AI Definition:** 

is where machines can what human can do.

**AI Definition:** 
Helping people and machines working together to create knowledge from data to enhances human expertise

**Module Three**

**What is Artificial Intelligence?**

AI is a sub field of computer science that aims at building computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence.

For years, the challenging goal of AI has been developing computer systems that equal or exceed human intelligence. AI-based machines are intended to perceive their environment and take actions that optimize their level of success.

AI research uses techniques from many fields, such as linguistics, economics, and psychology. These techniques are used in applications, such as control systems, natural language processing, facial recognition, speech recognition, business analytics, pattern matching, and data mining.
